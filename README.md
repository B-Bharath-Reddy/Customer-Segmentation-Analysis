# Customer Segmentation Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer data to gain insights into their demographics and spending behavior. The analysis included univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to understand the relationships between various features. Based on the insights gained, I identified three key features – age, income, and amount spent on purchases – as crucial factors for customer segmentation.

### Methodology
Utilizing K-means clustering, I segmented the customers into distinct groups based on their age, income level, and spending habits. I employed hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the clustering algorithm and ensure meaningful segmentation results.

### Key Findings
The analysis revealed distinct customer segments characterized by varying demographics and purchasing behavior. By focusing on age, income, and spending amount, I identified actionable insights to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer engagement.


### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven insights in understanding customer behavior and guiding business strategies. By leveraging machine learning techniques for customer segmentation, organizations can effectively target their marketing efforts and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
